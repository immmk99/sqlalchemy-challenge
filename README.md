**Honolulu Holiday Climate Analysis: Overview**

**Objective**
Prepare for a vacation in Honolulu by analyzing the local climate using tools like Python and SQLAlchemy.

### Part 1: Climate Data Analysis
- **Tools and Data**: Utilize `climate_starter.ipynb` and `hawaii.sqlite`.
- **Database Setup**: Connect to SQLite using SQLAlchemy, reflect tables, and create a session.
- **Analysis Tasks**:
  1. **Precipitation Analysis**: Chart the last 12 months of precipitation and summarize statistics.
  2. **Station Analysis**: Determine the most active weather station and analyze temperature data, including a histogram of temperature observations.

### Part 2: Climate API Design
- **Flask API**: Develop routes to access climate data:
  - **Homepage**: Lists all routes.
  - **Precipitation**: Returns last year's precipitation data as JSON.
  - **Stations**: Provides a JSON list of stations.
  - **Temperature Observations**: Shows the last year's temperatures from the most active station.
  - **Temperature Ranges**: Returns temperature statistics for given date ranges.

This streamlined approach efficiently summarizes key climate data to inform your travel planning.
